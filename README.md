This repository containers some data structure implementations that are 
commonly used. The code is contained in the lib directory for the:  
 -linked lists  
  - A data structure where each node(element) has a link to the next node
   in memory and are not stored in a contiguous block of memory but rather
   spread out and only a reference to the head is kept as compared to
   classic arrays  
 -Hashmap or Hash tables  
  - Hash maps store key value pairs of elements where the key acts as the
   the index and inorder to access the element, you use the key. Hash maps
    generally have first insertion, search and deletion operations.  
 -Binary Search Trees  
  - This is a kind of binary tree where the key of each internal node is
  greater than all the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones
   in the right subtree
